							<h3>Shea Salinas</h3>
							<h5>Elder Candidate</h5>
							<hr class="sep" />
							<p>Shea Salinas was born and raised in Texas where he did not grow up going to church, but came to know Jesus in high school. During his junior year, someone asked him if he was a Christian. He answered honestly with a casual, “Yeah. I believe in God and that Jesus existed.” His friend’s next words changed his life forever, saying “So does the devil.” This launched Shea into pursuing what it actually meant to have a relationship with Jesus, and came to know Jesus as his Lord and Savior shortly thereafter. He was baptized later that year.</p>
