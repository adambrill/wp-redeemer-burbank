					<h2>Gospel</h2>
					<h5><em>&#8220;Know &amp; Love the God Who Knows &amp; Loves You&#8221;</em></h5>
					<hr />

						<p>The gospel is the good news that we can enjoy a relationship with God and bring renewal to the world through the work, record, and performance of Jesus, rather than through our own perfor- mance. The gospel is how we both get in and grow in the Christian life. This message changes us from the inside out, transforming our hearts and our behavior. The gospel frees us to continually discover and say, “I am more broken and sinful than I ever dared believe, but in Jesus I am more loved and accepted than I ever dared hope.” This provides a radically new orientation to life and work for the people of Silicon Valley. The gospel of grace frees us from the idols that enslave us— frees us to live for God’s glory, not our own. What every human wants is to be both known and loved. The gospel announces that because of Jesus, we can have this: we can be known and loved by God. Jesus changes everything. Jesus gives his disciples a new identity, a new record, a new power, and a new future. The gospel is the driving center of everything we are and everything we do as a church. We not only proclaim the gospel, we aim to create a gospel culture at Garden City.</p>

					<h2>Family</h2>
					<h5><em>&#8220;Know &amp; Love One Another&#8221;</em></h5>
					<hr />
					<div class="text">
						<p>Through the gospel we gain a new family of deep and diverse friendships with brothers and sisters in Christ who come from all walks of life. The church is not a meeting you attend, it is a network of relationships you belong to—a big family that’s built upon grace and is busy pursuing Jesus’ mission together. As we do life together as members of a family, knowing and loving one another, our city will notice. “By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35). We gather and scatter in our city no longer living for ourselves, but as con- nected and committed members of a family/body. In community, Jesus changes us and uses us.</p>
						<p>He shrinks our pride and surfaces our gifts. We come to see that all people stand on equal ground at the foot of the cross, giving us a freeing humility that welcomes the messy and glorious work of being a family and finding our unique place in the family.</p>
						<p>As a family of men and women, we are all equal, but not the same. The church family is modeled off of the nuclear family, where both men and women ambitiously lead and contribute, yet with distinct roles that complement one another. Both men and women are equal and lead in our family, yet in a way that honors the distinctive leadership role God has given qualified men as the head of their homes and as pastors/elders. Our model is our Triune God—Father, Son, and Spirit—who have eternally enjoyed loving, servant-hearted community, yet with each member of the Trinity exercising different roles.</p>

					<h2>Image Bearers</h2>
					<h5><em>&#8220;Know &amp; Love Our City&#8221;</em></h5>
					<hr />
					<div class="text">
						<p>We are a church of missionaries where every member is on mission to delight in, declare, and demonstrate the gospel to our city, yet in diverse ways that are true to who we are as unique image bearers of God. Disciple-making isn’t something we add to our lives, it’s something we weave through all that we do as part of the diverse ways we’re each called to know and love our city. God wants us to thrive as image bearers, to use our unique design and calling to reveal God to the world and to help others flourish and discover more of who they are as image bearers of God. As we each carry out our callings with excellence, thoughtfulness, and prayer in the homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces where God has placed us, we advance not only our careers, but also the mission of God.</p>
						<p>We do our most fruitful mission work by living out our ordinary lives with gospel intentionality, not through attending a busy schedule of religious activities. As we each explore who we are and the unique work God has called us to do, we will be a church that makes Silicon Valley a better city. As one writer puts it, “The kind of work God usually calls you to is the kind of work that you need most to do and that the world needs most to have done…The place God calls you to is where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”</p>
