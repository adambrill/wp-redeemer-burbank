					<h3>What is Baptism?</h3>
					<hr />
					<div class="text">
						<p>Baptism is “going public” with your faith in Jesus. It’s our favorite thing to celebrate at Garden City! The earliest Christians would be baptized immediately upon placing their faith in Jesus as a symbol of their new life in Christ. Baptism is the act of immersing a believer under water and then bringing him/her out of the water, identifying the believer with Jesus (Acts 10:48; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27), with the universal church (1 Cor 12:13), and with the local church (Acts 2:41). God has given his church two sacraments: baptism (a one time event that we do upon entrance into the church family and communion (an ongoing event that we celebrate regularly with our church family once we’ve been baptized).

						<p>If you want to be baptized at our next baptisms, please fill out our <a href="connect.php">Connection Form</a> and let us know. We also encourage you to give a two-minute testimony about your life to those gathered as witnesses. This is not a requirement, but we believe your story will have a great impact for Jesus.
