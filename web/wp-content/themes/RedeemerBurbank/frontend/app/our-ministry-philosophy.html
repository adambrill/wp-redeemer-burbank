					<h2>Simple and Focused</h2>
					<hr>
					<div class="text">
						<p>We are focused on our mission at Garden City. We evaluate everything we do on the basis of whether or not it helps or hinders us from being disciples who make disciples. As a result, we have a very focused and simple philosophy of ministry at Garden City. We say that we are like In-N-Out Burger, a place that focuses on doing just two things (burgers and fries), but does those two things really well. In line with our mission and our core values, Garden City is focused on doing just two things really well: Gathering and Scattering.</p>
						<p>There is so much ministry and activity happening in and through our church, but it all flows from our rhythm of gathering and scattering. At Garden City you’ll find friends meeting for coffee, people serving the poor, one-on-one discipleship meetings, people playing together on a softball team or praying together downtown, parties and events, and so much more. But all of this is ministry and community, which is not officially planned by church leadership. It’s ministry that happens as an outflow of our rhythm of gathering and scattering.</p>

					<h2>Gathering</h2>
					<hr>
					<div class="text">
						<h5>Sundays</h5>
						<p>Every Sunday Garden City gathers as a big family to worship God, hear the preaching of God’s Word, grow in discipleship, love and serve one another, take part in the sacraments, be equipped for ministry, and be a gospel witness to Silicon Valley. Sundays fuel us for a new week of ministry in the city.</p>
						
						<h5>Life Groups</h5>
						<p>Every week, Garden City gathers in smaller family units called Life Groups. Life Groups are the backbone of our church–the place where knowing and loving one another, disciple-making, and advancing the mission take place at a more intimate and accountable level.</p>
						<p>Every Life Group operates around three commitments:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We will live on mission: We will be disciples making disciples who enjoy Jesus and love people.</li>
							<li>We will gather as a family each week to eat together, know and love one another, study along with the Garden City sermon series, and pray (Acts 2:42). This will include an emphasis on having fun together, gathering with our whole church family on Sundays, and taking a few short breaks throughout the year for the sake of refreshment.</li>
							<li>We will multiply. We will train and send people out of this Life Group to start at least one new Life Group within the span of two years.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Expectations</h5>
						<p>We expect everyone who becomes a member to make gathering at Garden City a high priority—to schedule life so as to be present and contribute to what takes place on Sundays and in Life Group. We think there are three great and acceptable reasons to miss gathering at Garden City.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Vacation: We want you to take vacation in order to rest, recharge, and have a lot of fun!</li>
							<li>Sickness: Please stay home if you’re sick! It is important that you rest and get well so that you can gather with your family again.</li>
							<li>A Special Event: Throughout the course of a year we expect that there will be rare and special events that you feel God has called you to, and which require you to miss out on gathering with your family. Examples include emergencies, business trips, weddings, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Gathering on Sundays and in your Life Group is critical to your own health, our whole church’s health, and it’s what fuels you for each new week of ministry in our city. Members prioritize gathering at the top of their weekly schedule. We are a church body that needs each member of the body to be present and functioning as a member of the body. We live in a city that is highly individualistic, where decisions are made only in reference to “me” and where even many Christians believe that passively attending a church service once or twice a month represents healthy Christianity. We are seeking to directly challenge and change this culture, to show our city what it looks like to belong to something much more exciting: a family on a mission to enjoy God, love one another, and love our city. We are seeking to be obedient to the New Testament, “Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it” (1 Cor. 12:27).</p>

						<h5>Garden City Events</h5>
						<p>From time to time we also gather at events that are sprinkled throughout the year— training classes, meetings, conferences, retreats, etc.—that supplement our disciple- making mission, but our focus remains on Sundays and Life Groups.</p>

					<h2>Scattering</h2>
					<hr>
					<div class="text">
						<p>We want everyone at Garden City to see themselves as missionaries to Silicon Valley. Most of Garden City’s ministry to the city happens during the week as software engineers, teachers, stay-at-home moms, carpenters, business leaders, college students, baristas, and entrepreneurs live out their vocations in their workplaces, neighborhoods, and homes with gospel intentionality, with a view towards making disciples and making an impact in our city for Jesus.</p>
						<p>Instead of asking you to attend a busy week of church programs, we want you scattered throughout our city, discovering the unique ways God wants to use you in our city. Our strategy for reaching the city is simple. Our strategy is people. Our strategy is the members of our church. Our strategy is you. God has already placed you in a particular place with particular relationships where you are called to advance the mission. We’re all learning from each other and we’re excited to learn from you and the unique ways God will use you to impact our city.</p>

						<h5>Disciples Making Disciples: Knowing, Loving, Training, Sending</h5>
						<p>At Garden City, we define discipleship as “truth and love transferred through relationship.” Through involvement with our rhythm of gathering and scattering, we want people to get engaged in discipleship relationships where truth is transferred and where they make progress, move forward, and mature as a disciple of Jesus. We have a simple discipleship process at Garden City where we help people move forward through four stages: Known, Loved, Trained, and Sent (See the discipleship process in the Appendix).</p>
						<p>As you move deeper into the life of our church you’ll grow familiar with this discipleship process. Our expectation is that every member at Garden City eventually gets to the place of always being able to answer the question, “Who are your guys/gals?” by stating the names of two or so guys/gals (Christian or non-Christian) who they are discipling and developing towards maturity in Christ. We expect the members of our church to be disciples who make disciples.</p>
