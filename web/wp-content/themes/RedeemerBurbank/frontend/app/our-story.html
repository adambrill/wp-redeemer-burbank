					<h1>Our Story</h1>
					<p>Garden City Church started with God. Therefore, our history is actually a rather long one. We believe that before the beginning of time God had a plan for Garden City and how we would impact our city — “He chose us in him before the foundation of the world…” (Eph 1:4).</p>

					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>In 2011, Justin Buzzard, along with his wife and three young sons, moved to Silicon Valley with a dream. The God-given dream was to start a new church that would engage the people of Silicon Valley with the gospel in a new and profound way. The day they moved they had only three people committed to the church plant and just $3,000 in the church bank account. It was a move of faith, banking on Jesus’ words “I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matt. 16:18).</p>
					<p>After meeting for a few months as a core group of about 30 people, Garden City Church launched on September 18th, 2011. The church began to grow. The church grew through the compelling power of the gospel, through people who were converted and discipled, through people who joined the church family as members and began contributing to the mission, through people who developed into leaders, and through much prayer.</p>
					<p>Jesus is on the move in and through Garden City. Jesus is building our church.</p>
