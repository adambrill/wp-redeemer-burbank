						<p>At Garden City, we define discipleship as “growing in truth and love through relationship.” Through involvement with our rhythm of gathering and scattering, we want people to get engaged in discipleship relationships/friendships where they grow in truth and love—where they make progress, move forward, and mature as a disciple of Jesus. We have a simple discipleship process at Garden City where we help people move forward through four stages: Known, Loved, Trained, and Sent.</p>
						<p>As you move deeper into the life of our church our hope is that you grow deeper as a disciple and wider in your reach of growing other disciples. Our expectation is that every member at Garden City enjoys relationships with Christians inside our church or non-Christians outside our church  who they are intentionally, dependently growing towards maturity in Christ. We expect the members of our church to be personally growing as disciples, and to help others grow as disciples.</p>

					<h3>Premarital Counseling</h3>
					<hr>
					<div class="text">
						<p>We believe in marriage; Not just a “let’s see how this goes and we can have an escape plan” marriage, but an “until death do us part, forever and ever” marriage.</p>
						<p>We believe these kind of marriages happen best when they get off to a good start. A great way for that to happen is for the couple to go through premarital counseling. At Garden City we offer a premarital counseling course for Christian couples interested in taking that big step of marriage together. For more information, contact our Associate Pastor <a href="mailto:fred@gardencitysv.com">Fred Mok</a>.</p>
